# E-Commerce Cloud Platform (DevOps Squad) by team Password1234 

This project is a fully automated microservices platform deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). We have refactored the base template and implemented our own custom infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines.

## Completed Technical Requirements
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Fully managed via Terraform (GKE Autopilot).
- **CI/CD:** Custom GitHub Actions pipelines implemented for `frontend` and `cartservice`.
- **Environments:** Isolated `staging` and `production` environments implemented using K8S namespaces.
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus and Grafana configured for system health and performance monitoring.
